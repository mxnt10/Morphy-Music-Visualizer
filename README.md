# [Morphy](https://kartik4042.github.io/Morphy-Music-Visualizer/)

Morphy is a visually and acoustically pleasing music visualizer for Windows and Linux. 

This project was developed during Computer Graphics and Visualizations Lab of our Engineering course in Computer Science.

The project was awarded first place in _JIT Graphics Day - An Intercollegiate Project Exhibition_ for its stellar presentation and applications.

### Overview
Morphy is a simple implementation of audio data visualization. For the given input audio file, program will give amplitude vs frequency plot by performing Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) on the audio samples. Visualization is achieved using OpenGL. This Project is implemented in C++ using OpenGL, LodePNG, SFML & Kiss FFT. User interaction is achieved using keyboard.
